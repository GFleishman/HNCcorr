Welcome to HNCcorr's documentation!
===================================

This implementation of the HNCcorr algorithm identifies cell bodies in two-photon calcium imaging movies. HNCcorr is described in detail in our `eNeuro paper <http://www.eneuro.org/content/6/2/ENEURO.0304-18.2019>`_.

The code consists of modular components that can be configured to your liking.

If you use HNCcorr for academic purposes, please cite the following paper:
