Welcome to HNCcorr's documentation!
===================================

This implementation of the HNCcorr algorithm identifies cell bodies in two-photon calcium imaging movies. HNCcorr is described in detail in our `arXiv paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01999>`_.

The code consists of modular components that can be configured to your liking.

If you use HNCcorr for academic purposes, please cite the following paper:
